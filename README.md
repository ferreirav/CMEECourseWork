This is my CMEE Repository.

This is part of my training on Computational Biology at Imperial College London.

Here you will find my weekly coursework that is instryucted by the [TheMulQuaBio](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html) repository.


Over this course I will gain competence over programming languages such as BASH, Pyhton and R.


If you have any questions regarding the materials please get in touch.
