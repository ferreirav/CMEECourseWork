# Week 7

In this folder are the scripts and essential data to run the practicals from the week dedicated for numerical computing with Python. Inside the folder [code](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/tree/master/week7/code) you will find the following scripts:

- [fmr.R](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/fmr.R) - an R script with information to test execution profiling

- [LV1.py](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/LV1.py) - a script with a Lotka-Volterra model, numerical integration and plotting

- [LV2.py](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/LV2.py) - an alternative Lotka-Voltera model script which takes user inputs and generates plotting after numerical integration 

- [profileme.py](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/profileme.py) - script contains functions to test profiling

- [profileme2.py](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/profileme2.py) - Script with profile improvements by using list comprehensions and concatenation

- [run_fmr_R.py](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/run_fmr_R.py) - This script loads and executes an fmr.R file, it uses python process wrappers to inform about success of execution

- [run_LV.py](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/run_LV.py) - script that calls the Lotka-Voltera scripts for profiling

- [timeitme.py](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/timeitme.py) - This script imports functions from another two scripts and run profiling tests

## Groupwork Practicals Scripts:

- [CompareSpeed.sh](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/CompareSpeed.sh) - a bash script file that runs the vectorize versions of R and Python

- [Vectorize1.py](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/Vectorize1.py) - This script compares the speed of loops and in-built vectorized function under Python

- [Vectorize1.R](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/Vectorize1.R) - This script compares the speed of loops and in-built vectorized function using R

- [Vectorize2.py](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/Vectorize2.py) - This script vectorizes stochastic Ricker function under Python

- [Vectorize2.R](https://github.com/vitorlcferreira/CMEECourseWork/blob/master/week7/code/Vectorize2.R) - Runs the stochastic Ricker equation with gaussian fluctuations
